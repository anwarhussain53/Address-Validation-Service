Overview
This project is a simple Java application that demonstrates basic database interaction using JDBC. It includes a servlet-based web service to validate and query address data based on pincode from a MySQL database.

Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
Apache Tomcat (or any Java servlet container)
MySQL Database
Setup Instructions
Database Setup:

Create a MySQL database named avs.
Create a table named Address with columns locality, pincode, sub_district, district, and state.

    pincode INT,
    sub_district VARCHAR(255),
    district VARCHAR(255),
    state VARCHAR(255)
);
Database Configuration:

Update the database URL (jdbcUrl), username, and password in com.avs.db.Avs class according to your MySQL setup.
Deploying the Application:

Compile the project and package it as a WAR file.
Deploy the WAR file to Apache Tomcat or any servlet container.
Accessing the Application:

Start Apache Tomcat.
Access the address form through http://localhost:8080/avs-web/avs-service.
Submit the form to query address details based on the provided pincode.
Usage
Fill in the address form with locality, pincode, sub-district, district, and state.
Click the "Submit" button to send a POST request to the servlet (AvsService) and retrieve address details based on the provided pincode.
Notes
This project uses JDBC for database connectivity and servlets for handling HTTP requests.
Ensure proper exception handling and logging in a production environment.
Customize and expand the functionality based on your project requirements.
Ensure to replace your-web-app-name with the actual name of your web application directory. This README provides a concise overview of setting up, deploying, and using the Address Validation Service application.
